Pressurised Water Reactors</div>

<div class="wrapper">

    <div class="box">This is the most common type, with about 300 operable reactors for power generation and several hundred more employed for naval propulsion. The design of PWRs originated as a submarine power plant</div>
    <div class="box"> PWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and moderator. The design is distinguished by having a primary cooling circuit which flows through the core of the reactor under very high pressure, and a secondary circuit in which steam is generated to drive the turbine. In Russia these are known as VVER types â€“ water-moderated and -cooled.</div>
    <div class="box">A PWR has fuel assemblies of 200-300 rods each, arranged vertically in the core, and a large reactor would have about 150-250 fuel assemblies with 80-100 tonnes of uranium.</div>
